    <p>These variables will be prompted into the environment that executes the terraform command.
        Some backend providers require additional environment variables to pass configuration items that should not
        be injected into the general build environment. These environment variables are scoped to only the
        execution the terraform command.
    </p>
    <p>List each variable in VAR=value form on separate lines. If value contains space, surround it with appropriate
        double quotation marks.</p>
    <p>Variables may also be promoted from the build environment to the terraform execution environment by listing
       them by name here. For instance, using the
       <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/envinject">Environment Injector Plugin</a> to inject user defined
       environment variables into the build script. Then, list those variables by name here to promote into
       the terraform command execution.
    </p>
    <p>These variables are common to all terraform commands.</p>
