    <p>Provide an optional condition that must be met before the destroy infrastructure is invoked. This allows build
        properties to control if the terraform destroy command is executed. If left blank, the infrastructure will be
        unconditional destroyed upon completion of the build.
        This option utilizes the Boolean condition from
        <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/run-condition/">Run Condition plugin</a>.
