    <p>If the backend provider has been configured to use remote state, this option omits the
        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">-state</span> command line option.
        There is no state file created locally in the working directory. Use this option only if the terraform
        configuration includes a backend remote state provider.</p>
    <p>Remote state is the best way to handle ensuring synchronization between build agents if multiple jenkins
        slaves are used in the build cluster. See (https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html).</p>
