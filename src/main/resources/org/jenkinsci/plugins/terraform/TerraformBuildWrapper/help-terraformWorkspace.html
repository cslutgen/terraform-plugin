    <p>If specified, terraform workspaces are utilized with the specified name by executing the following commands.
        If the workspace does not exist, it will be created.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">terraform workspace new "name"</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">terraform workspace select "name"</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If specified along with "Destroy on Build Completion", the workspace will also be deleted along with the
    managed resources.</p>
    <p>Workspaces can be used with supporting remote backends. If not, the Jenkins workspace is used and must
    be properly protected from deletion and sharing to allow multiple Terraform workspaces to coexist.</p>
    <p>Use blank to disable workspaces selection, i.e. terraform workspace will not be called.</p>
    <p>Use "default" select the default terraform workspace.</p>
    <p>Workspaces allow multiple users, environments, configurations to share the same configuration
        while storing unique state per workspace.</p>
